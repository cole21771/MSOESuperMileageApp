### Tasks

Required

- [ ] update wireframes
- [ ] pushing data to the server
- [ ] server details editing
- [ ] simple server authentication
- [ ] Verify that the amount of data from the arduino matches the amount of data in the config json.
- [ ] A status indicator will show if the server is connected at any given time.
- [ ] If a connection is lost, the app will try to resume it.
- [ ] Add a dedicated view for the information of a config file.

Nice to have

- [ ] Pull down to refresh server status.
- [ ] When you hold down on a server, it should open the edit server modal
- [ ] Information in the dedicated config can be collapsed/expanded
- [ ] Sliding animations
- [ ] (Do this last) Send random data from app. Will probably be a separate activity from normal "Main Activity"

Some day

- [ ] Be able to talk back to the Arduino
- [ ] Be able to receive data from the Arduino with 100% consistency

### Issues

- [ ] When typing in the Server IP and Server Port sections of the add server page, the number keyboard should show up
